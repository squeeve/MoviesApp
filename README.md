Activity 1: Demonstrate that the Navigation Drawer and App Bar works, but using them to allow the user to navigate to two other activities.

Activity 2: Uses RecyclerView to display a list of movies.  
(Note: I think I missed the requirement that the details are either loaded in the same container and replaces the list or else needed to be loaded on the side, depending on the screen size.)

Activity 3: Randomly picks a movie from the list of movies, and displays details about it as a fragment within the current activity.
